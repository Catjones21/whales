<p><h1>History of The Greywhale:</h1>
<div class="columnqueen">


Scientific Name: <b>Eschrichtus robustus</b> <p>

Whales are believed to have evolved from <b>mesonychids</b>: furry land mammals that lived around the ancient Tethys Sea
(now Mediterranean Sea) and parts of the Asian sub-continent, 55-60 million years ago. <p>

 Archaeocetes were the first ancient whale-like animals to evolve around 10 million years later.

 <p>

25-30 million years ago these whales split into the toother (odontocetes) and baleen (mysticetes) whales.
 <p>

Around 5 million years ago the modern families of whales had become established.

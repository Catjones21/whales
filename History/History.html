    <h1>More About Whales</h1>

    <h2>History of Whales</h2>
<p><h3>Evolution:</h3>
Whales are believed to have evolved from mesonychids: furry land mammals that lived around the ancient Tethys Sea
(now Mediterranean Sea) and parts of the Asian sub-continent, 55-60 million years ago.

 Archaeocetes were the first ancient whale-like animals to evolve around 10 million years later.

25-30 million years ago these whales split into the toother (odontocetes) and baleen (mysticetes) whales.

Around 5 million years ago the modern families of whales had become established.

Scientific Name: Eschrichtus robustus

The grey whale was nicknamed ‘Devilfish’ by whalers for their ferocity in the face of danger when being hunted; whilst their food stocks are at danger
 from melting arctic ice, the grey whale has made a significant recovery since the height of the whaling industry.

  The fact that they sometimes approach boats out of curiosity and are now known as the friendly whale,
	even though we hunted them to commercial extinction, makes them my favourite organism.
